## **Course Introduction**

Welcome to the **Nano Movie Recommender System** course! This course is designed to guide you through the process of building a **lightweight movie recommender system** from scratch. Whether you are new to recommender systems or have prior experience, this course will provide you with a structured approach to understanding, designing, and implementing a working prototype.

Throughout this course, we will explore:

- The fundamental concepts behind recommender systems.
- The process of designing a minimal yet functional recommender system.
- Technical choices such as using **JSON instead of a database** and **Streamlit instead of other frameworks**.
- Step-by-step implementation of core functionalities, leading to a fully operational prototype.

By the end of this course, you will be able to **design and build a basic recommender system**, understand the challenges like the **cold start problem**, and explore ways to enhance and extend your system.

## **Course Outline**

### **Class 1: What Is a Recommender System?**

- Introduction to recommender systems: What are they, and why are they important?
- Different types of recommender systems (collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, hybrid methods).
- How do companies like Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon use recommendation systems?
- How to design a simple recommender system.

### **Class 2: How to Design a Nano Recommender System**

- What are the essential components if we just want to run a minimal demo?
- Why do we choose **JSON instead of a traditional database**? (Advantages, trade-offs)
- Why do we use **Streamlit instead of other frameworks**? (Ease of use, rapid prototyping)
- How should we structure the code for clarity and scalability?

### **Class 3: How to Set Up the Development Environment**

- Setting up a Python environment using **Conda**.
- Installing **VSCode** and configuring it for efficient development.
- Introduction to virtual environments and package management.

### **Class 4: How to Design the Data Structure**

- Understanding **JSON** and why it is used for storing structured data.
- What kind of data is required for a movie recommender system?
- How should we structure our dataset to make recommendations effective?

### **Class 5: How to Get the JSON Data**

- Writing Python code to retrieve, parse, and manipulate JSON data.
- Loading and processing movie data for recommendations.
- Handling missing data and potential issues.

### **Class 6: How to Write the Streamlit Website to Show the Data**

- Introduction to **Streamlit** and how it simplifies web app development.
- How to display movie recommendations interactively.
- Implementing basic **data visualization** to improve user experience.

### **Class 7: What Else Can We Do?**

- Introduction to the **cold start problem** (what it is and why it matters).
- Discussing potential **improvements**: filtering techniques, adding more data sources, using machine learning for better recommendations.
- Open-ended exploration: What are the next steps if you want to scale this system?
