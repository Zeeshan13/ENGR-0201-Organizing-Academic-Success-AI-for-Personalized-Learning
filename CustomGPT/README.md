### Assignment: **Build Your CustomGPT**


#### **Objective**  
Create a functional CustomGPT tailored to a specific use case of your team‚Äôs choice from the provided examples. Your CustomGPT should follow a structured design process, implementing prompts, workflows, and features to align with its intended purpose. Teams can implement the CustomGPT in ChatGPT Pro if available or submit a detailed prompt system if implementation is not possible.

### **Assignment Breakdown**

---

#### **Part 1: Planning and Roles (10 points)**  
- Form a team of up to 5 members and assign roles, ensuring coverage for:
  - Prompt Design
  - Workflow Creation
  - Testing and Refinement
  - Documentation and Submission
- Submit a **Team Plan** with:
  - Selected CustomGPT use case  
  - Member roles and responsibilities  
  - Timeline for completion  

---

#### **Part 2: Prompt System Design (30 points)**  
- Develop a full set of prompts tailored to your chosen use case.  
- Prompts should:  
  - Gather input from users effectively  
  - Guide workflows logically  
  - Include error-handling and refinement options  
  - Encourage iteration and customization  

**Example:** For a **Midjourney Helper**, prompts might include:

- ‚ÄúWould you like to refine this style further?‚Äù  

**Evaluation Criteria:**  
- Clarity and relevance of prompts (15 points)  
- Alignment with the chosen use case‚Äôs objectives (10 points)  
- Robustness of error-handling and iteration options (5 points)  

---

#### **Part 3: Workflow and Functionality Design (20 points)**  
- Map out the user workflow, including:  
  - Input collection  
  - Output generation  
  - Iterative refinements  
  - Error handling  
- Ensure the workflow supports a seamless and logical user experience.  

**Evaluation Criteria:**  
- Logical progression and usability of the workflow (10 points)  
- Coverage of all necessary functionality for the selected use case (10 points)  

---

#### **Part 4: Advanced Features and Testing (20 points)**  
- Propose and design at least one advanced feature relevant to your use case. Examples include:  
  - Template-based inputs for Midjourney prompts  
  - Scenario simulations for Bear‚Äôs Drinking Game Maker  
  - Advanced graph generation for Math to LaTeX  
- Test your CustomGPT (or prompt system) and collect team feedback to refine it.  

**Evaluation Criteria:**  
- Creativity and relevance of the advanced feature (10 points)  
- Effectiveness of testing and refinements (10 points)  

---

#### **Part 5: Implementation or Submission (20 points)**  

1. **If Implementing in ChatGPT Pro**:  
   - Deploy the CustomGPT and test its functionality.  
   - Submit screenshots or a video demonstrating the workflow.  
   - Provide real examples of user interactions.  

2. **If Submitting Prompts**:  
   - Submit a structured document with the full prompt system and workflows.  
   - Include examples of expected user interactions and outputs.  

**Evaluation Criteria:**  
- Functionality and completeness of the implemented CustomGPT (20 points)  
**OR**  
- Clarity, depth, and usability of the prompt system (20 points)  

---

### **Submission Requirements**

1. **Team Plan**: Outline roles, timeline, and selected use case.  
2. **Prompt System**: Complete set of prompts aligned with the use case.  
3. **Workflow Documentation**: A clear explanation of user interaction flows.  
4. **Advanced Features**: Description and examples of the advanced feature(s).  
5. **Testing Results**: Summary of feedback and refinements.  
6. **Implementation Evidence**: Screenshots, video, or detailed examples (if applicable).
